# System Monitor & App Usage Tracker

A real-time monitoring application that tracks app usage and sends SMS alerts for suspicious activities like VPN usage, incognito browsing, and more.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, navigate to your project folder and install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- `express` - Web server framework
- `cors` - Cross-origin resource sharing
- `twilio` - SMS alert service

### 2. Start the Server

Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see: `🚀 Server running at http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Open the Frontend

Simply open `index.html` in your browser by:
- Double-clicking the file, OR
- Right-click → Open with → Your browser, OR
- Drag and drop into your browser

## About Those Console Errors

The errors you're seeing in the console are **completely normal** and won't affect your app:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
Connecting to 'http://localhost:5000/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json'
```

**Why this happens:**
- Chrome DevTools automatically tries to connect to a debugging endpoint
- This is a Chrome feature for debugging extensions/apps
- Your server doesn't have this endpoint (and doesn't need it!)
- The app works perfectly fine despite these messages

**How to hide them:**
1. Click on "Default levels" dropdown in the Console
2. Uncheck "Errors" temporarily
3. Or just ignore them - they don't affect functionality

## Features

✅ **Real-time Monitoring** - Track all application usage
✅ **SMS Alerts** - Get notified of suspicious activities via Twilio
✅ **Anomaly Detection** - Detects VPN, incognito mode, excessive usage
✅ **Manual Logging** - Add entries manually
✅ **Date Filtering** - Filter logs by date range
✅ **Statistics Dashboard** - View usage statistics at a glance

## Configuration

Edit these values in `server.js`:

```javascript
const TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_account_sid';
const TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_auth_token';
const TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = '+1234567890';
const REGISTERED_PHONE_NUMBER = '+0987654321';
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /log-usage` - Add a new log entry
- `GET /all-logs` - Get all logs
- `GET /get-logs?startTime=X&stopTime=Y` - Get filtered logs
- `DELETE /clear-logs` - Clear all logs
- `POST /test-alert` - Send a test SMS
- `GET /stats` - Get usage statistics
- `GET /monitoring-status` - Check monitoring status
- `GET /health` - Health check

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Make sure port 5000 is not in use
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `npm install`

### Frontend can't connect to server
- Verify server is running on http://localhost:5000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Make sure you're not using HTTPS for the HTML file

### SMS alerts not working
- Verify Twilio credentials are correct
- Check that phone numbers include country codes
- Test with the "Test SMS Alert" button

## Security Note

⚠️ **Important:** Your Twilio credentials are currently hardcoded in the server file. For production:
1. Use environment variables
2. Never commit credentials to Git
3. Add `.env` file to `.gitignore`

Example with environment variables:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
const TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;
```
